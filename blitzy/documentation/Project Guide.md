## 🚀 Development Guide

This comprehensive guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the application. All commands have been tested and verified to work correctly.

### System Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Python | 3.12.3+ | Runtime environment |
| Git | Any | Version control |
| Operating System | Linux/macOS/Windows | Any OS with Python support |

### Environment Setup

#### Step 1: Navigate to Repository

```bash
cd /tmp/blitzy/quick-repo-4/blitzy5ac8b7b87
```

**Expected Output:** Command completes successfully with no output.

#### Step 2: Verify Python Installation

```bash
python --version
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Python 3.12.3
```

*Note: Python 3.6+ should work, but 3.12.3 has been tested and verified.*

#### Step 3: Activate Virtual Environment (Optional)

If you want to use an isolated Python environment:

```bash
# Virtual environment already exists in the repository
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

**Expected Output:** Your terminal prompt will show `(venv)` prefix.

*Note: Virtual environment is optional for this simple project as there are no external dependencies.*

### Compilation

Python compiles source files automatically on import, but you can manually verify compilation:

```bash
python -m py_compile test.py
```

**Expected Output:** Command completes with no output (success is silent).

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la __pycache__/
```

You should see `test.cpython-312.pyc` or similar compiled bytecode file.

### Application Usage

#### Method 1: Interactive Python Shell

```bash
python
```

Then in the Python shell:

```python
>>> import test
>>> result = test.add(5, 7)
>>> print(result)
12
>>> exit()
```

#### Method 2: One-Line Command

```bash
python -c "import test; print(test.add(10, 20))"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
30
```

#### Method 3: Create a Script

```bash
cat > example.py << 'EOF'
import test

# Test various number combinations
result1 = test.add(5, 3)
result2 = test.add(-10, 5)
result3 = test.add(1.5, 2.5)
result4 = test.add(0, 0)

print(f"5 + 3 = {result1}")
print(f"-10 + 5 = {result2}")
print(f"1.5 + 2.5 = {result3}")
print(f"0 + 0 = {result4}")
EOF

python example.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5 + 3 = 8
-10 + 5 = -5
1.5 + 2.5 = 4.0
0 + 0 = 0
```

### Verification Steps

#### Verify Import Works

```bash
python -c "import test; print('✅ Import successful')"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Import successful
```

#### Verify Function Execution

```bash
python -c "import test; result = test.add(100, 200); assert result == 300; print('✅ Function works correctly')"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Function works correctly
```

#### Run Comprehensive Tests

```bash
python << 'EOF'
import test

print("Running comprehensive test suite...")
tests = [
    (2, 3, 5, "Positive integers"),
    (-1, -1, -2, "Negative integers"),
    (10, -5, 5, "Mixed signs"),
    (0, 0, 0, "Zero handling"),
    (1.5, 2.5, 4.0, "Floating point"),
    (1000000, 1000000, 2000000, "Large numbers"),
]

passed = 0
failed = 0

for a, b, expected, description in tests:
    result = test.add(a, b)
    if result == expected:
        print(f"✅ PASS: {description} - add({a}, {b}) = {result}")
        passed += 1
    else:
        print(f"❌ FAIL: {description} - add({a}, {b}) = {result} (expected {expected})")
        failed += 1

print(f"\nResults: {passed}/{len(tests)} tests passed")
if failed == 0:
    print("✅ All tests passed!")
EOF
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Running comprehensive test suite...
✅ PASS: Positive integers - add(2, 3) = 5
✅ PASS: Negative integers - add(-1, -1) = -2
✅ PASS: Mixed signs - add(10, -5) = 5
✅ PASS: Zero handling - add(0, 0) = 0
✅ PASS: Floating point - add(1.5, 2.5) = 4.0
✅ PASS: Large numbers - add(1000000, 1000000) = 2000000

Results: 6/6 tests passed
✅ All tests passed!
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test'"

**Solution:** Ensure you're running Python from the repository root directory:
```bash
cd /tmp/blitzy/quick-repo-4/blitzy5ac8b7b87
python -c "import test"
```

#### Issue: "Permission denied" when running commands

**Solution:** Ensure you have read permissions on test.py:
```bash
chmod +r test.py
```

#### Issue: Python version mismatch

**Solution:** This code is compatible with Python 3.6+. Verify your Python version:
```bash
python --version
```

If you have multiple Python versions installed, you may need to use `python3`:
```bash
python3 --version
python3 -c "import test; print(test.add(1, 2))"
```

### Example Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: Basic Arithmetic

```python
import test

# Simple addition
total = test.add(42, 8)
print(f"The answer is {total}")  # Output: The answer is 50
```

#### Use Case 2: Accumulating Values

```python
import test

# Accumulate a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = 0
for num in numbers:
    total = test.add(total, num)
print(f"Sum: {total}")  # Output: Sum: 150
```

#### Use Case 3: Working with Floats

```python
import test

# Financial calculations
price1 = 19.99
price2 = 24.95
total = test.add(price1, price2)
print(f"Total: ${total:.2f}")  # Output: Total: $44.94
```
